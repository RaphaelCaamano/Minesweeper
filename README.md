# Minesweeper:
Implemented the Minesweeper game by creating a 10x10 grid and placing random hidden "bombs." Each position in the grind represents a button; press it, and it reveals what is underneath. Unless there is no bomb, each button interior will display the number of how many bombs are in that one-tile radius. Win or lose, the game will prompt whether to play once more or close the application.
